## Version 2.0-rc1
* `RxTxComm` has been successfully replaced with `jSerialComm` and tested with RTU
* The whole codebase has been re-vamped to use modern constructs and practises, not a single class has remained untouched
* Codebase is compatible with JDK 1.6
* Javadoc has been extensively improved and fixed
* A logging framework (log4j) has been included with a wrapper to improve performance and allow token passing
* We have some tests!! Unit tests have been added for all automation friendly protocols (UDP and TCP)
* Unit tests have been added that independently verify the j2mod TCP Slave functionality
* Threading and concurrency has been hugely improved - removed synchronisation errors and corrected the handling of thread shutdown
* Brought some sanity to the Facade package so that it is now usable in a production setting
* Removed the serial BIN transport - it was proprietary and not taken up by any hardware vendors that I could find
* Fixed the UDP transport for both Master and Slave so that it is some way approaching robust
* Fixed the code layout - everything has headers, the layout is consistent, variable names and scope make sense etc.
* Build system incorporates GPG signing and is compatible with one-click deployment to Maven Central through Sonatype

## Version 2.0-rc2
* Added ability to specify timeout for Facade classes `ModbusTCPMaster`, `ModbusUDPMaster` and `ModbusSerialMaster`

* Added more test cases

## Version 2.0-rc4
* Fixed an issue with the `TCPTransaction` class not initialising the Transport correctly

* Responded to vulnerabilities highlighted by FindBugs

## Version 2.3.9
* Critical regression introduced in previous release whereby the sharing of stream buffers was being trampled over
* Serial CRC was not correctly checking both bytes

## Version 2.4.0
* The transport RTU over TCP was not being set correctly after a comms failure
* The Slave interface was not always correctly assigning the headers (Transaction ID, Function Code. Unit ID) for all types of requests
* Fully tested the RTU over TCP transport with some real hardware

## Version 2.4.1
* Fixed some error messages
* Added more logging and made the TCP transaction a little more robust

## Version 2.4.2
* Fixed a critical issue with RTU over TCP when the connection is set to re-connecting. 
Initial connection correctly uses `ModbusRTUTCPTransport` but subsequent connections use `ModbusTCPTransport` - RTU Over TCP Resend Bug #71

## Version 2.5.0
* Upgraded to the latest version of `JSerialComm` - this fixes issues with closing Windows COM ports and many other problems
It also allows us to manage the built-in latency timeouts within `JSerialComm`
* Add unit tests for the serial implementation of RTU and ASCII (Windows only)
* Made the closing and shutdown of a Serial Listener more robust
* Fixed an issue whereby if a Serial Slave was created using the `ModbusSlaveFactory` is closed independently, and the then the slave
is reused with different serial parameters, the old parameters would have been used instead
* Removed all JavaDoc compilation warnings 

## Version 2.5.1
##### _Note:- v2.5.1 is not backwards compatible with v2.5.0_
Some changes may be required for applications using this version. The changes bellow detail where a non-compatible change has been made.
* Removed the deprecated `ModbusCoupler` implementation - users should switch their code to use `SlaveFactory` and apply their `ProcessImage` instances to the slave directly
The new implementation means that `ProcessImage` is not coupled to a slave and can be shared across slaves and unit IDs
_(**NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE**)_
* Added a method `getError` to `ModbusSlave` to enable users to get any startup errors after a slave is opened #72
* Fixed the issue whereby serial slaves will respond with error messages for requests that are targeted for them #62
* Updated the documentation and byline
* Moved the useRtuOverTcp flag to constructor #75
_(**NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE**)_
* Fixed getConnection.isOpen() still true after serial-port removal #74
* Implemented inter-frame delays for serial transactions to match the Modbus specification #62
* Fixed - Why doesn't DigitalOut extend DigitalIn #86
* Made library an OSGi bundle #67 thanks amitjoy
* Removed all `final` qualifiers where it prevents extensibility and doesn't add any value #85
* Added default thread names to listeners and methods to get/set it on the slave #80
* Fixed Error in ReadInputDiscretesRequest class SetBitCount() method. Can't access the last address. #87

## Version 2.5.2
* Removed a lot of synchronized decorated methods to put the onus on the caller and speed up processing. #88 

## Version 2.5.3
* Added check of serial response to make sure it is from the same unit and function code as the request
* Return the new value of the register after writing to it (#91)
* Fix data length in MaskWriteRegisterResponse. Add facade methods for Mask Write Response function. Add unit tests. (#92)
