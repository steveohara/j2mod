## Version 2.0-rc1
* RxTxComm has been successfully replaced with jSerialComm and tested with RTU
* The whole codebase has been re-vamped to use modern constructs and practises, not a single class has remained untouched
* Codebase is compatible with JDK 1.6
* Javadoc has been extensively improved and fixed
* A logging framework (log4j) has been included with a wrapper to improve performance and allow token passing
* We have some tests!! Unit tests have been added for all automation friendly protocols (UDP and TCP)
* Unit tests have been added that independently verify the j2mod TCP Slave functionality
* Threading and concurrency has been hugely improved - removed synchronisation errors and corrected the handling of thread shutdown
* Brought some sanity to the Facade package so that it is now usable in a production setting
* Removed the serial BIN transport - it was proprietary and not taken up by any hardware vendors that I could find
* Fixed the UDP transport for both Master and Slave so that it is some way approaching robust
* Fixed the code layout - everything has headers, the layout is consistent, variable names and scope make sense etc.
* Build system incorporates GPG signing and is compatible with one-click deployment to Maven Central through Sonatype

## Version 2.0-rc2
* Added ability to specify timeout for Facade classes 'ModbusTCPMaster', 'ModbusUDPMaster' and 'ModbusSerialMaster'
* Fixed all the Unit ID checking when running as a Slave (myriad of problems - cannot see how it has ever worked)

## Version 2.0-rc3
* Fixed the timeouts for UDP/TCP and Serial listeners
* Added more test cases

## Version 2.0-rc4
* Fixed an issue with the TCPTransaction class not initialising the Transport correctly
* Removed all redundant casts
* Made Transport available from Facade classes so that listeners can be added for Serial events

## Version 2.0-rc5
* Serial timeouts were being applied to a null transport

## Version 2.0
* Replaced log4j with slf4j

## Version 2.1
* Corrections to ASCII transport - thanks transparentink
* Added fix for infinite listening loop - thanks martentamerius

* Fix unit tests on linux #9 - thanks martentamerius
* Improved logging of errors and warnings with stack trace #10 - thanks martentamerius
* Facilitate multiple processimages in ModbusCoupler. #11 - thanks martentamerius
* WriteMultipleRegisters (Function Code : 0x10) does not work. #14 - chnaged use of signed shorts to unsigned
* Serial/RTU slower on 2.x #16 - worked around an issue with jSerialComm where setting timeouts on an open port injected a 200ms delay

## Version 2.1.1
* Corrected a problem with applying the timeouts when using the facade pattern

## Version 2.1.2
* Retrieve the localPort from opened socket if port is set to 0 #19

* Corrected timeout setting issues on serial ports and harmonised setting timeout with IP methods

## Version 2.1.3
* Added support for Modbus RTU over TCP #21 - thanks axuan25
* Code requires guards around a number of the functions #22

## Version 2.2.0
* Modbus Slave Multiple Port Support #23
* Set ModbusCoupler to deprecated in favour of the new ModbusSlaveFactory and ModbusSlave sub-system
* Fixed some javadoc errors - thanks jan
* Timeout error on socket listener - thanks jan
* Now allows for slaves to share same socket but different protocols

## Version 2.2.1
* Amend TCPMasterConnection socket timeout handling #27 - thanks David

## Version 2.2.2
* Fixed NPE in close method of SerialConnection if Comms port was never successfully opened

## Version 2.3.0
* Adjusted write timers with fiddle factors to allow for idiosyncratic hardware
* jSerialComm library decoupled from implementation #28 - thanks Felipe

## Version 2.3.1
* Length of ReadWriteMultipleResponse indicates 1 byte too much? #31 - thanks elasticoder
* Function code 0x17 first performs a read and then the write. #32 - thanks elasticoder
* Double socket creation in ModbusTCP. #33 - thanks stoorm5

## Version 2.3.2
* Increased maximum queue length for incoming connections. #38 - thanks martentamerius
* Incorrect javadoc for ModbusSlaveFactory #35 - thanks bertrik
* Adds setRetries and setCheckingValidity services into ModbusTCPMaster #30 - thanks ericauguie
* Added RTU over TCP #43 - thanks eli-mcgowan
* Fixed setting timeout of TCPMaster does not get applied to transactions #41
* Reduce an NPE - Serial port connection #40
* Fixed issue with serial write bytes delay if data bits not specified

## Version 2.3.3
* Specify IP address in ModbusSlaveFactory #46 - thanks MindVark
* Added getConnection() to AbstractSerialConnection - thanks nnadeau
* Reading full stream instead of parts - thanks liebehentze

## Version 2.3.4
* Fixed NullpointException at handleRequest in AbstractModbusListener #47
* Add checks to see if serial port is available during connect #45

## Version 2.3.5
* Fixed a typo in the failure debug message
* Fixed the omission of the bit count when reading a DiscreteInput request

## Version 2.3.7
* Fixed a format error in the thrown connection retry catch block
* Propagate ModbusTCPListener timeout to the TCPSlaveConnection #59 - thanks javi
* Not possible to override handleRequest in ModbusSlave #57 - thanks javi

## Version 2.3.8
* Added a sleep timer to the TCP/UDP/serial transaction retry loops
* Added the timeout value to the serial write
* Responded to vulnerabilities highlighted by FindBugs

## Version 2.3.9
* Critical regression introduced in previous release whereby the sharing of stream buffers was being trampled over
* Serial CRC was not correctly checking both bytes
